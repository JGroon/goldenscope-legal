# GoldenScope — Terms of Use

**Last Updated: February 1, 2026**

Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully before using the GoldenScope mobile application ("App"). By downloading, installing, or using GoldenScope, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

---

## 1. About the App

GoldenScope is a photography planning tool that provides estimated terrain analysis, sun and moon positioning data, weather forecasts, and location suggestions to assist photographers in finding potential photo opportunities. The App uses publicly available data sources including elevation data, OpenStreetMap geographic features, and weather forecasts to generate its suggestions.

## 2. Informational Purposes Only

All location suggestions, terrain analysis, photo scores, trail access indicators, weather ratings, land status indicators, and other data presented in the App are provided for **informational and planning purposes only**. GoldenScope does not provide navigation services, guarantee the accuracy of any information, or make any representations about the suitability or safety of any location.

## 3. No Guarantee of Accuracy

The App relies on third-party data sources that may be incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate. Specifically:

- **Elevation and terrain data** is based on satellite-derived datasets with limited resolution and may not reflect current ground conditions.
- **Land ownership and access status** is derived from publicly available datasets that are often incomplete. A location shown as "Public Land" may not be fully accessible, and a location shown as "Unknown" or "Verify Access" may be public or private. **The App cannot reliably determine land ownership or access rights for any location.**
- **Trail and path data** is sourced from OpenStreetMap, a community-maintained database. Trails may be unmapped, unmaintained, closed, rerouted, or inaccurately mapped.
- **Weather forecasts** are estimates provided by third-party services and are not guaranteed to be accurate.
- **Scenic feature data** (lakes, peaks, viewpoints, waterfalls, etc.) is sourced from OpenStreetMap and may be incomplete or inaccurately tagged.

## 4. User Responsibility and Assumption of Risk

By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that:

- **You are solely responsible for verifying land access permissions** before visiting any location suggested by the App. This includes checking whether land is public or private, whether access permits are required, and whether seasonal closures or restrictions apply.
- **You are solely responsible for your own safety.** Locations suggested by the App may involve hazardous terrain, exposure to weather, wildlife, unstable ground, steep cliffs, water hazards, avalanche risk, or other dangers. The App does not assess safety conditions.
- **You are solely responsible for your physical preparedness** for reaching any location. Trail access indicators are estimates only and do not account for trail conditions, difficulty, fitness requirements, or necessary equipment.
- **You should not rely solely on the App for trip planning.** Always cross-reference with official land management agency resources, current trail guides, recent trip reports, and local regulations.
- **You assume all risk** associated with traveling to, accessing, and being present at any location you choose to visit based on information from the App.

## 5. Prohibited Uses

You agree not to:

- Use the App to access private property without authorization
- Use the App to access restricted, closed, or protected areas
- Rely on the App as your sole source of navigation or safety information
- Use the App in any way that violates local, state, or federal laws or regulations
- Redistribute, reverse engineer, or commercially exploit the App's data or algorithms

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, GoldenScope and its developer shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from:

- Your use of or reliance on any information provided by the App
- Any injury, death, property damage, trespassing charges, fines, or other harm resulting from visiting locations suggested by the App
- Any inaccuracy, incompleteness, or error in the App's data, suggestions, or calculations
- Any failure of the App to function, including but not limited to loss of connectivity, data loss, or software errors
- Any actions taken by third parties based on information from the App

**You use the App entirely at your own risk.**

## 7. Third-Party Data and Services

The App incorporates data and services from third parties including but not limited to:

- Open-Meteo (elevation and weather data)
- OpenStreetMap via Overpass API (geographic features, trails)
- Google Maps / Apple Maps (map display)
- SunCalc (sun and moon position calculations)

These third-party services are governed by their own terms of use and privacy policies. GoldenScope is not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or content of third-party data.

## 8. Intellectual Property

All content, design, algorithms, and code within the App are the property of the developer. OpenStreetMap data is provided under the Open Database License (ODbL). Open-Meteo data is provided under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).

## 9. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms. We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document when changes are made.

## 10. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties.
