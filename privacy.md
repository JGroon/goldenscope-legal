# GoldenScope — Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 1, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how GoldenScope ("App", "we", "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the GoldenScope mobile application.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **Saved Spots**: When you save photo locations, that data is stored locally on your device.
- **Preferences**: Your app settings such as preferred map type, scout preferences, and filter selections are stored locally on your device.

### Information Collected Automatically
- **Device Location**: When you grant location permission, the App accesses your device's GPS coordinates to center the map on your location, calculate sun and moon positions for your area, and fetch local weather forecasts. Your location data is used in real-time and is not stored on any external server.
- **Scout Queries**: When you use Scout Mode, your selected coordinates and radius are sent to third-party APIs (Open-Meteo, OpenStreetMap Overpass API) to retrieve elevation, weather, and geographic feature data. These queries contain geographic coordinates only — no personal identifying information.

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any account credentials (the App does not require an account).
- We do not collect photos, camera data, or image files.
- We do not track your movements or store location history.
- We do not collect device identifiers for advertising purposes.
- We do not sell, share, or transmit any personal data to third parties for marketing or advertising.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Your information is used solely to provide the App's core functionality:

- **Location data** is used to show your position on the map, calculate sun and moon timing for your area, and fetch relevant weather forecasts.
- **Scout coordinates** are sent to third-party data APIs to retrieve terrain, weather, and geographic feature data needed to generate photo location suggestions.
- **Saved spots and preferences** are stored locally on your device to preserve your data between sessions.

## 3. Data Storage

All user data (saved spots, preferences, cached elevation data, cached weather data) is stored **locally on your device** using on-device storage. We do not operate external servers or cloud databases that store your personal data.

If you delete the App, all locally stored data is permanently removed from your device.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The App sends geographic coordinate data (latitude and longitude only) to the following third-party services to retrieve publicly available data:

- **Open-Meteo** (open-meteo.com) — Elevation data and weather forecasts. Open-Meteo's privacy policy is available at their website.
- **OpenStreetMap Overpass API** (overpass-api.de) — Geographic features such as lakes, peaks, trails, and viewpoints. OpenStreetMap's privacy policy is available at wiki.openstreetmap.org.
- **Google Maps SDK** (Android) / **Apple Maps** (iOS) — Map tile display. These services are governed by Google's and Apple's respective privacy policies.

These third-party services receive only geographic coordinates necessary to fulfill data requests. No personal identifying information is transmitted.

## 5. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information through the App, please contact us.

## 6. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Since all user data is stored locally on your device, data security is primarily managed through your device's own security features (passcode, biometrics, encryption). We recommend keeping your device's operating system updated.

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

- **Location Permission**: You can grant or revoke location access at any time through your device's settings. The App will function with limited capability without location access — you can still browse curated spots and manually set scout locations.
- **Delete Data**: You can delete all saved spots and cached data within the App's settings, or by deleting and reinstalling the App.
- **Offline Use**: Cached data stored on your device can be accessed without an internet connection. No data is transmitted when you are offline.

## 8. California Residents (CCPA)

If you are a California resident, you have the right to know what personal information is collected and how it is used. As described above, GoldenScope collects only device location data (when permitted) and stores all data locally on your device. We do not sell personal information to third parties.

## 9. European Users (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area, you have rights under the General Data Protection Regulation including the right to access, correct, and delete your personal data. Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have direct control over your data at all times. Geographic coordinates sent to third-party APIs for data retrieval are processed on the basis of legitimate interest in providing the App's core functionality.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document when changes are made. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
